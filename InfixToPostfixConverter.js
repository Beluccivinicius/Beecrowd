// DESCRIPTION:
// Construct a function that, when given a string containing an
// expression in infix notation,
// will return an identical expression in postfix notation.

// The operators used will be +, -, *, /, and ^ with left-associativity
//  of all operators but ^.

// The precedence of the operators (most important to least) are : 1)
//  parentheses, 2) exponentiation, 3) times/divide, 4) plus/minus.

// The operands will be single-digit integers between 0 and 9,
// inclusive.

// Parentheses may be included in the input, and are guaranteed
// to be in correct pairs.
